In shadows deep, where silence speaks in sighs,
Beneath the moon's soft, watchful, silver eyes.
In every heart, a hidden world does sleep,
Where dreams and fears in tangled webs do creep.

Yet, from these depths, a spark of hope can rise,
Illuminating dark, eternal skies.
For in the night's embrace, our spirits leap,
Finding strength in what we've sown, to reap.
